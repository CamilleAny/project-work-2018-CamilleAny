# ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) on the result of a TOXCAT experiment

The data that I used come from my Master thesis project, which was done under the supervision of Jean-Pierre Duneau and Eric Durand at the "Laboratoire d'Ingénierie des Systèmes Macromoléculaires" (UMR7255) CNRS Marseille. 

To run the notebook, you need to install Anaconda and to run the environment :

* `conda env create -f environment.yml`

* `activate Toxcat_environment`
